# WiFi Marauder companion app for Flipper Zero

Requires a connected dev board running Marauder FW. [See install instructions from UberGuidoZ here.](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Wifi_DevBoard#marauder-install-information)

## Get the app
1. Make sure you're logged in with a github account (otherwise the downloads in step 2 won't work)
2. Navigate to the [FAP Build](https://github.com/0xchocolate/flipperzero-wifi-marauder/actions/workflows/build.yml)
   GitHub action workflow, and select the most recent run, scroll down to artifacts.
3. The FAP is built for the `dev` and `release` channels of both official and unleashed
   firmware. Download the artifact corresponding to your firmware version.
4. Extract `ESP32_WiFi_Marauder.fap` from the ZIP file to your Flipper
   Zero SD card, preferably under Apps/GPIO along with the rest of the GPIO apps.

From a local clone of this repo, you can also build the app yourself using ufbt.

## In-app ESP32 flasher (WIP)
The app now contains a work-in-progress of an ESP32 flasher (close to the bottom of the menu). Use at your own risk. This hardcodes addresses for non-S3 ESP32 chips, and you'll need to source your own bootloader, partition table, and application bin files.

If you use it, make sure you put your board into reflash mode first (generally by pressing RESET while holding BOOT).

This process will improve with future updates! :)
