# ublox
Flipper Zero app to read from a u-blox GPS over I2C. This used to be
in my repository `flipped`, but got to be both large and good enough
to merit its own repo. Furthermore, I really, truly fixed the awful
memory leak that had been plaguing this app for months, so now feature
development can continue.
